# Digital Product Management Final Portfolio Project

### My Final Project of College

Using all the different skills I have accumulated across the semester, I created a portfolio project. The project entailed knowledge of HTML, CSS, GitHub, Azure, and Visual Studio Code.

I began with an HTML template from free-css.com. Then, I changed all the text on the page to content personalized to me. Next, I found images that fit the text and changed the template pictures to my pictures. I won't go step-by-step, but this is just to give you an idea of the process. Most recently, I added flavicon and social media meta tags, which provide some personality to the page when the link is shared.
